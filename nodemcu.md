## ¿Qué es NodeMCU?
---
* **Deifinición Web oficial:** "An open-source firmware and development kit that helps you to prototype your IOT product within a few Lua script lines."

* **Definición Wikipedia:** "NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. The term "NodeMCU" by default refers to the firmware rather than the dev kits. The firmware uses the Lua scripting language. It is based on the eLua project, and built on the Espressif Non-OS SDK for ESP8266. It uses many open source projects, such as lua-cjson, and spiffs."
